	<p>The MemoPage of minipad2 combines the functions of reminders, to-do-list and scheduled tasks. <br>
	Use "File"-->"New ExtPage"--><a href='..\Menus\Menus_File.html#m_newmemo'>"New MemoPage"</a> to create a new MemoPage.</p>

	<h2>Basic Use</h2>
	
	<p>Use "Edit"--><a href='..\Menus\Menus_Edit.html#m_newitem'>"New Item"</a> (or double-click on any empty place inside of memopage) to open the "New Reminder" dialog to create a new reminder/to-do/task.<br>
	Double-click an existing reminder to open the "Edit Reminder" dialog to modify this item.<br>
	After the pre-defined remind-time has been reached, a pop-up reminder window will appear in the right-lower side of the desktop, with a beep-sound (if it's defined). If you want to close the pop-up and remind again after some minutes, you can set the next remind-time in the pop-up window. <br>
	To delete an existing reminder, right-click it and choose <a href='..\Menus\Menus_Edit.html#m_delete'>"Delete Item"</a>.<br>
	To adjust the positions of reminders, select the item and drag it to the target position.<br>
